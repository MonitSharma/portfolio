### Quantum Enhanced Simulation Based Optimization for Newsvendor Problems

[Publication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17389)  

- We utilize the maximum profit formulation for the Newsvendor Problem, which has broader applicability compared to the minimal loss formulation commonly found in the literature.
- Our approach involves an unknown demand distribution, where a function may not precisely capture the demand in such settings, to address this, we employ Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (qGANs) to load the unknown demand distribution, thereby creating a more realistic scenario.
- We improve the simulation-based optimization method in by introducing a new comparison operator, thereby reducing the number of qubits needed in the circuit.

### Quantum Relaxation for Solving Multiple Knapsack Problems

[Publication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19474)

- Explored the effectiveness of QRAO in addressing the inherent complexities of constrained supply chain problems, by solving a Multiple Knapsack Problem (MKP) and comparing it with the well-studied QAOA approach.
- Scaled up a real-world multiple knapsack-based Risk-Aware Procurement Optimization problem involving ≥ 100 variables and demonstrating the prospect of combining QRAO with a classical method in operations research, namely Linear Relaxation (LR)
