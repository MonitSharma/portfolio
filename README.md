## Research Projects


### Cutting Slack: Quantum Optimization with Slack Free Methods for Combinatorial Benchmarks  
**Publication:** [arXiv:2507.12159](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12159)  

- **Overview:** Introduces **slack‑free Lagrangian-based methods**—including dual ascent, bundle methods, cutting planes, and augmented Lagrangian—to enforce constraints in QUBO formulations without introducing slack variables.

- **Framework:**  
  - Dualizes constraints via Lagrange multipliers and uses iterative updates (subgradient, bundle, cutting‑plane, augmented Lagrangian) to embed constraints directly into the optimization objective.  
- **Target Problems:**  
  - **TSP:** Applies Held–Karp relaxation to eliminate degree‑constraint slack variables.  
  - **MDKP:** Inequality constraints allow slack‑free encoding, reducing QUBO size.  
  - **MIS:** Even without slack-variable elimination, Lagrangian updates enhance feasibility and solution quality.  
- **Techniques:**  
  - Implements multiple dual-update strategies—subgradient, bundle, cutting-plane, and augmented Lagrangian—on quantum simulators and hardware.  
  - Benchmarks constraint handling via Lagrangian methods vs. traditional slack-augmented QUBO.  
- **Results:**  
  - **Qubit savings:** Significant reductions for TSP and MDKP through slack elimination.  
  - **Feasibility & performance:** Maintained or improved solution quality; MIS also benefits from constraint handling despite no qubit reduction.  
  - Demonstrates Lagrangian formulations as a scalable, resource-efficient alternative to penalty/sack-variable approaches.

### Adaptive Graph Shrinking for Quantum Optimization of Constrained Combinatorial Problems  
**Publication:** [arXiv:2506.14250](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14250)

- **Overview:** Proposes a hybrid classical–quantum framework to tackle large constrained combinatorial optimization problems on quantum hardware by intelligently reducing problem size.
- **Framework:** Introduces **constraint-aware graph shrinking**, a verification-and-repair pipeline, and **adaptive strategies** (e.g., correlation recalculation and spectral stopping criteria) to compress QUBO instances while preserving problem structure.
- **Target Problems:** Applies the method to benchmark problems including the Multi-Dimensional Knapsack Problem (MDKP), Maximum Independent Set (MIS), and Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) using QUBO-to-Max-Cut transformations.
- **Techniques:** Leverages semidefinite programming (SDP)-based correlation matrices and graph neural network–inspired merging heuristics to adaptively coarsen the graph.
- **Results:** Achieves **40–80% qubit count reduction**, with minimal or no loss in solution quality and strong feasibility retention, on both simulated and quantum hardware instances.

### A Comparative Study of Quantum Optimization Techniques for Solving Combinatorial Optimization Benchmark Problems
**Publication:** [arXiv:2503.12121](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12121)

- **Overview:** Quantum optimization holds promise for addressing classically intractable combinatorial problems, yet a standardized benchmarking framework is still lacking.
- **Framework:** Introduces a comprehensive approach to evaluate quantum optimization techniques against NP-hard problems such as the Multi-Dimensional Knapsack Problem (MDKP), Maximum Independent Set (MIS), Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP), and Market Share Problem (MSP).
- **Techniques:** Benchmarks gate-based approaches like the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and its CVaR variant, alongside advanced methods such as the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and its extensions.
- **Additional Methods:** Incorporates qubit compression techniques like Pauli Correlation Encoding (PCE) and Quantum Random Access Optimization (QRAO).
- **Results:** Provides insights into feasibility, optimality gaps, and scalability based on experiments with simulated quantum environments and classical solvers.
