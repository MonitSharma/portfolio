## Research Projects

### A Comparative Study of Quantum Optimization Techniques for Solving Combinatorial Optimization Benchmark Problems
**Publication:** [arXiv:2503.12121](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12121)

- **Overview:** Quantum optimization holds promise for addressing classically intractable combinatorial problems, yet a standardized benchmarking framework is still lacking.
- **Framework:** Introduces a comprehensive approach to evaluate quantum optimization techniques against NP-hard problems such as the Multi-Dimensional Knapsack Problem (MDKP), Maximum Independent Set (MIS), Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP), and Market Share Problem (MSP).
- **Techniques:** Benchmarks gate-based approaches like the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and its CVaR variant, alongside advanced methods such as the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and its extensions.
- **Additional Methods:** Incorporates qubit compression techniques like Pauli Correlation Encoding (PCE) and Quantum Random Access Optimization (QRAO).
- **Results:** Provides insights into feasibility, optimality gaps, and scalability based on experiments with simulated quantum environments and classical solvers.

### Quantum Monte Carlo Methods for Newsvendor Problem with Multiple Unreliable Suppliers
**Publication:** [arXiv:2409.07183](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07183)

- **Overview:** Addresses the challenges in inventory management amid increased supply chain uncertainties in a post-pandemic world.
- **Focus:** Integrates decision-makers' risk preferences into the classic newsvendor model.
- **Technique:** Utilizes Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) combined with Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE) for efficient probability and expectation value estimation—offering a near-quadratic speedup over classical methods.
- **Impact:** Illuminates the link between risk-aware decision-making and inventory management, contributing to enhanced supply chain resilience.

### Quantum Enhanced Simulation-Based Optimization for Newsvendor Problems
**Publication:** [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10821393)

- **Overview:** Utilizes a maximum profit formulation for the Newsvendor Problem to broaden its applicability beyond traditional minimal loss approaches.
- **Innovation:** Employs Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (qGANs) to model unknown demand distributions, creating more realistic scenarios.
- **Improvement:** Introduces a new comparison operator that reduces the number of qubits required in the simulation circuit.

### Quantum Relaxation for Solving Multiple Knapsack Problems
**Publication:** [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10821401)

- **Overview:** Investigates the effectiveness of Quantum Random Access Optimization (QRAO) in tackling complex constrained supply chain issues.
- **Application:** Demonstrates the solution of a Multiple Knapsack Problem (MKP) using QRAO combined with classical methods like Linear Relaxation (LR) on a real-world risk-aware procurement optimization problem involving over 100 variables.
- **Insight:** Highlights the potential of integrating quantum relaxation techniques with traditional optimization methods to enhance problem-solving capabilities.
