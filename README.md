### Quantum Monte Carlo methods for Newsvendor problem with Multiple Unreliable Suppliers

[Publication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07183)  

- In the post-pandemic world, manufacturing enterprises face increasing uncertainties, especially with vulnerabilities in global supply chains. Although supply chain management has been extensively studied, the critical influence of decision-makers (DMs) in these systems remains underexplored. 
- This study studies the inventory management problem under risk using the newsvendor model by incorporating DMs risk preferences. By employing the Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) combined with Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE) algorithm, the estimation of probabilities or expectation values can be done more efficiently. 
- This offers near-quadratic speedup compared to classical Monte Carlo methods. Our findings illuminate the intricate relationship between risk-aware decision-making and inventory management, providing essential insights for enhancing supply chain resilience and adaptability in uncertain conditions

### Quantum Enhanced Simulation Based Optimization for Newsvendor Problems

[Publication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17389)  

- We utilize the maximum profit formulation for the Newsvendor Problem, which has broader applicability compared to the minimal loss formulation commonly found in the literature.
- Our approach involves an unknown demand distribution, where a function may not precisely capture the demand in such settings, to address this, we employ Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (qGANs) to load the unknown demand distribution, thereby creating a more realistic scenario.
- We improve the simulation-based optimization method in by introducing a new comparison operator, thereby reducing the number of qubits needed in the circuit.

### Quantum Relaxation for Solving Multiple Knapsack Problems

[Publication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19474)

- Explored the effectiveness of QRAO in addressing the inherent complexities of constrained supply chain problems, by solving a Multiple Knapsack Problem (MKP) and comparing it with the well-studied QAOA approach.
- Scaled up a real-world multiple knapsack-based Risk-Aware Procurement Optimization problem involving â‰¥ 100 variables and demonstrating the prospect of combining QRAO with a classical method in operations research, namely Linear Relaxation (LR)
