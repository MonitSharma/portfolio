bio: |
  I am a Research Engineer at Singapore Management University, bridging the gap between near-term quantum hardware and industrial applications. My work focuses on designing hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for large-scale optimization problems in logistics and supply chain management. I specialize in leveraging GPU/TPU acceleration to benchmark quantum approaches against state-of-the-art classical heuristics.
